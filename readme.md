[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lcaballero/rstamp-new-node-intellij.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/) [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/rstamp-new-node-intellij.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/rstamp-new-node-intellij)

# Introduction

Generates some folders and files for the latest version of IntelliJ.  This is
handy for turning a newly generated npm (one generated by rstamp and new-npm)
into a Web/Node project at the command line.  After this runs you can then
open IntellJ on that directory.

On Mac this might look like this:

```
open -a 'IntelliJ IDEA 13'
```


## Installation

```
%> npm install -g rstamp-new-node-intellij
```

## Usage

```
%> rstamp --generate new-node-intellij
```
